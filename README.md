Project I started to train a little bit JavaScript OOP

# What is this?
A friend of mine who is studying CS told me about a project he's working on in school. A web-based role playing game. I remembered when I was studying, we had a similar project, C++ based. It was tons of fun, and I wanted to do it again, this time web-based.

In the spirit of working more with OOP in JavaScript, I started this little project. I don't know yet where it is going, just playing around here.
